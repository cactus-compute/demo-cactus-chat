# Build

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn run
   ```

<ins>**NOTE**<ins> - Cactus relies on native modules, which aren't supported by the `expo start` command.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Clean slate

To definitively clear your build and re-build the project from scratch:

```bash
 rm -rm node_modules ios android .expo
```

Then, return to the **Get Started** steps.

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
